# CPU-MIPS-PIPELINE-DESIGN
This is the project of the course 'MIPS Processor Design Experiment' in Jilin University, China. Currently I have implemented the classical 5-stage pipepline with 50 instructions.
The exception and interrupt haven't be achieved throughly yet, with only part of them available.

I understand that it can be challenging to grasp my design approach by just looking at the code. Therefore, I will upload a clear diagram outlining my design concept when I have time.
